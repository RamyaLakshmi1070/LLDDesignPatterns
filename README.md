LLD - Strategy Pattern vs Inheritance ðŸš€
This project demonstrates two approaches to implementing vehicle behaviors:

Without Strategy Pattern (Inheritance-Based Approach)
With Strategy Pattern (Flexible & Scalable Approach)
ðŸ“Œ Problem with Inheritance Approach
In the Inheritance-Based Approach, each vehicle type (SportyVehicle, PassengerVehicle, NormalVehicle) overrides the Drive() method. This leads to:

  Code duplication if multiple classes share the same logic.
  Tightly coupled code making modifications harder.
  Violation of the Open/Closed Principle â€“ new behaviors require modifying existing classes.
  
âœ… Strategy Pattern Solution
The Strategy Pattern resolves these issues by:

  Encapsulating driving behaviors in separate classes (FastDrive, NormalDrive).
  Using composition instead of inheritance â€“ Vehicle has a DriveStrategy.
  Enabling dynamic behavior changes at runtime.
